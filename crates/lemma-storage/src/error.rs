//! Error types for `lemma-storage`.
//!
//! [`StorageError`] is the single error type for all storage operations in
//! this crate: RocksDB I/O, column family access, Merkle trie operations,
//! world state reads/writes, and state snapshot management.
//!
//! # Why one flat enum?
//!
//! `lemma-storage` is focused on a single concern: persistence. One enum is
//! simpler and avoids unnecessary wrapping (same reasoning as `CryptoError`
//! in `lemma-crypto`).
//!
//! External errors (`rocksdb::Error`, `bincode::Error`) are stored as
//! `String` so this enum remains `Clone + PartialEq + Eq` — consistent with
//! all other error types in the Lemma codebase.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use lemma_storage::StorageError;
//!
//! fn open_db(path: &str) -> Result<(), StorageError> {
//!     // ...
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
